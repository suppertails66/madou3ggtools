This package contains the source materials (code/art/script) for the English
translation project for the Game Gear game Madou Monogatari III: Kyuukyoku
Joou-sama.

                    ****************************************
                    
The build system is only set up for Unix-like systems, though none of the code
is fundamentally dependent on this and could be ported with a bit of effort.
You'll need GCC and libpng.

Get a ROM image of the original game. There are two revisions of the game; as
they are nearly identical, either one can be used. Make sure your ROM matches
one of the following specifications:

  Original release:
    No-Intro filename: Madou Monogatari III - Kyuukyoku Joou-sama (Japan).gg
    CRC32:             0A634D79
    MD5:               B8B5305EC2F68D7BB3C9F622A13EBA7C
    SHA-1:             DD590C9086161B1F97573C48720C32CC5506DABC

  Revision 1:
    No-Intro filename: Madou Monogatari III - Kyuukyoku Joou-sama (Japan) (Rev 
1).gg
    CRC32:             568F4825
    MD5:               1294C965ABDD845F554B30B311DEE272
    SHA-1:             673670F954176FFAB28A0280AA49856A457F36B1

Rename it "madou3.gg" and place it in the "madou3" folder. Then:

$ cd madou3
$ ./build.sh

build.sh should then build all the necessary tools and output the translated
ROM as madou3_en.gg.

If you want to modify the project, check build.sh to see where the resources
that get inserted into the game are coming from.

is under the terms of whoever wrote it.
