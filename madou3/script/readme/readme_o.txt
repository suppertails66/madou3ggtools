Having vanquished Satan in the events of Sorcery Saga II, magician-in-training Arle Nadja and her new companion Carbuncle continue their journey to the Ancient Magic School. But trouble once more finds them on the road when they are ambushed by Rulue, a mysterious woman who declares her undying love for Satan and traps them in a labyrinth. Aided by the citizens of the Frog Empire, can Arle escape the Minotauros's labyrinth and exact vengeance on Rulue?

Sorcery Saga III: The Ultimate Queen (Madou Monogatari III: Kyuukyoku Joou-sama) is a dungeon crawler by Compile that's probably best known as the basis for the Puyo Puyo series. The game was originally released on various Japanese home computers, but this patch targets the later port/remake for the Sega Game Gear.

This patch fully translates the game into English.

You'll first need a ROM image of Madou Monogatari III: Kyuukyoku Joou-sama for the Game Gear.

There are two known revisions of the game. Due to the two versions being nearly identical, this patch will work with either one. Make sure your ROM matches one of the following specifications:

Original release:
  No-Intro filename: Madou Monogatari III - Kyuukyoku Joou-sama (Japan).gg
  CRC32:             0A634D79
  MD5:               B8B5305EC2F68D7BB3C9F622A13EBA7C
  SHA-1:             DD590C9086161B1F97573C48720C32CC5506DABC

Revision 1:
  No-Intro filename: Madou Monogatari III - Kyuukyoku Joou-sama (Japan) (Rev 1).gg
  CRC32:             568F4825
  MD5:               1294C965ABDD845F554B30B311DEE272
  SHA-1:             673670F954176FFAB28A0280AA49856A457F36B1

The patch itself is a standard IPS patch. Use a tool such as Lunar IPS to apply the IPS file to the ROM. The patch will expand the ROM to 1 MB, so don't use ancient patching utilities that don't support that.

  Sorcery Saga 3 is the final mainline story entry of the series for the GG. We released the patch for the second game in the series a while ago, and so it was only natural to pick up the third game. Interestingly, this and "A" are the entries which were changed the most compared with the PC originals. There are completely new plot points, dungeons, enemies and friendly characters involved, but the main story remains more or less the same. It’s still quite fun and unique due to the changes, so we definitely enjoyed working on it. When it comes to the script, there were a couple of puns here and there which needed to be localized, but nothing too major overall. So, we hope you enjoy this game… and stay tuned for SS: A in the future!
